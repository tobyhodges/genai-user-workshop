# Proposed Target Audiences

## Workshop 1: for novices to programming
Learners with no previous experience of writing code, who want/need to begin analysing data (for research).
These learners may already be making routine use of a generative AI chatbot, in some cases including the use of these tools to generate ("vibe code") small scripts and programs.
By participating in this workshop, they hope to learn how they could use generative AI as part of their own software development and/or data analysis.
This workshop will help them consider the importance of developing their own coding ability to augment the use of genAI and become less reliant on it.
By gaining an appreciation of the limitations of genAI tools and the implications of their use in terms of ethics and research integrity, they will leave the workshop ready to make informed decisions about whether, when and how to use genAI in their future software and data projects.

## Workshop 2: for programming competent practitioners
Learners with a foundational mental model of programming and the skills to write code independently for some tasks but who have not yet developed expertise/skills to work quickly or adapt easily to new kinds of tasks and contexts.
They may already be making routine use of a generative AI chatbot, perhaps including the use of these tools to help them write code and/or to generate complete scripts and programs.
By participating in this workshop, they hope to augment their existing programming skills and make (more) effective use of generative AI in software development and/or data analysis.
This workshop will help them think critically about their use of generative AI, make informed decisions about when to use it, evaluate its outputs, and validate the code it produces.
It will help them proceed with confidence in their future work by enabling them to identify the most appropriate model for a given task, construct better prompts to obtain code that does what they need, and take responsibility for the results produced by that code.
By gaining an appreciation of the limitations of genAI tools and the implications of their use in terms of ethics and research integrity, they will leave the workshop ready to make informed decisions about whether, when and how to use genAI and acknowledge its use appropriately in their future software and data projects.
